description: "You are surrounded. There's nothing else to say.
          Ennemies will come from every direction, you'll need to learn to bait air units and dispatch of them quickly.
        If you do manage to survive the ennemy will probably give up at some point, but for fuck's sake never stop building as some extremely powerful guardians may come."
