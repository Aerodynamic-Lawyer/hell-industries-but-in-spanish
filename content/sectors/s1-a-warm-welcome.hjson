description: "So uh yeah. 
  You can mine dunite walls to get osmium and carcenerite walls to get well, carcenerite.

  Put wall grinders on ash walls to get ash (duh) and don't forget to build fast else you will be swarmed quickly.

  We need you to take this because uh our unpaid intern accidentally sold Persephone to the malis team and like that's no good or some shit."
